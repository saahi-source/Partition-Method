# Partition-Method

This implements two partition methods used in QuickSort: Lomuto partition and Hoare partition.
Both methods are written in Java and tested using JUnit.

Files:

Partition.java – Contains the Lomuto and Hoare partition methods.

PartitionTest.java – Contains unit tests for both methods.


The unit tests use the following arrays:

{10, 17, 19, 21, 44, 55, 57, 63, 65, 67}

{} (empty array)

{84, 3, 7, 1, 9, 6, 2, 5}

The tests check that elements are correctly placed around the pivot.

How to Run:

Open the project in a Java IDE (VS Code)

Run PartitionTest.
